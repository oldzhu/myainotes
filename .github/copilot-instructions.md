# Project instructions (long-term)

These instructions apply to work in `/home/oldzhu/mynotes`, especially the vLLM notes under `vllm/`.

## 1) Bilingual documentation policy (required)

- Every English Markdown file must have a matching Simplified Chinese file with the same base name and a `.zh-CN.md` suffix.
- Every pair must include a language switch link near the top, e.g.:
  - `[English](doc.md) | [Chinese (ZH-CN)](doc.zh-CN.md)` in English files
  - `[English](doc.md) | [简体中文](doc.zh-CN.md)` in Chinese files
- Reports under `vllm/reports/` follow the same bilingual policy.
- Keep both versions in sync when editing or creating docs.
- Validate before committing with: `make bilingual-check` (from `/home/oldzhu/mynotes/vllm`).

## 2) Notes repo scope

- Primary notes live in `/home/oldzhu/mynotes/vllm`.
- Do not modify the main vLLM source repo unless explicitly requested.

## 3) Generated docs

- `vllm/vllm-custom-ops-catalog.md` is generated by `vllm/scripts/extract_vllm_custom_ops_catalog.py`.
- Regenerate after changes to the extractor or custom ops list, and ensure the language switch remains in the generated file.

## 4) Index and discovery

- Keep `vllm/README.md` and `vllm/README.zh-CN.md` updated with links to new documents.

## 5) Mapping-table deliverable (next major doc)

- The mapping table should include:
  - Python call site + GPT inference purpose (map to formulas/papers if relevant)
  - Native C++/CUDA/ROCm source file + description + pseudo-code
- Provide both English and Simplified Chinese versions.
